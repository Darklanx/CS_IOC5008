# Homework README
In this course you will practice training deep neural network to solve severals computer vision problems, e.g. Image classification, Instance segmentation. You can choose the deep learning framework which you are familiar with. If you are a newbie in deep learning framework, we recommend you learn Pytorch. We highly encourage students who are not familiar with Python or Pytorch/Keras/TensorFlow to complete the following tutorials first.
- [Python/Numpy tutorial](http://cs231n.github.io/python-numpy-tutorial/)
- [Pytorch tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/)
- [Keras tutorial](https://elitedatascience.com/keras-tutorial-deep-learning-in-python)
- [TensorFlow tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials)

## When to hand in
The homeworks are due at 11:59pm. The due dates for all homeworks are on the [syllabus page](https://github.com/NCTU-VRDL/CS_IOC5008#syllabus).
## Late Policy
We will deduct a late penalty of 20% per additional late day.
## Where to hand in
Most of homeworks need you attend a private Kaggle competition, make your submission before deadline. And please also mail your reports to TA Jimmy at d08922002@ntu.edu.tw with format ```<STUDENT-ID>_HW<NUMBER>```, e.g. ```0656001_HW2```. Your HW should include
- Reports (in PDF)
  - Introduction
  - Methodology
  - Findings or Summary
- Submission files or Resutls (Please see the README in each HW folder for detail)
## Grading Policy
- Model performance (70%): You can get 50% by scoring over baseline (in Kaggle learderbaord) for each HW. Rank top 3 in leaderboard can get extra point on your final score
- Reports (20%): Well-document the data summary, methodology or any findings in your HW
- Code readability (10%): Python code style should follow [PEP8](https://realpython.com/python-pep8/) for readability
## GPU Resource
You may need GPU to accelerate the training of deep nenural network. We provide several free GPU resource for you, some of resource need registration and limited by usage.
- [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/gpu.ipynb): Free GPU usage for 24 hours
- [FloydHub](https://www.floydhub.com/): Registration for free GPU trials
- [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/virtual-machines/linux/)): Registration for free GPU trials
